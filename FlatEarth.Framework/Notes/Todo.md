# Todo

- Create my own content management, loading textures from file with hot reloading.
- Implement my own engine loop with a fixed update and realtime update: [fix your timestep](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/)
- Remove as much monogameness from my framework as possible, (game objects, components, the game class, etc)
- Start from the ground up, only add features that do not inform the game design.
  - This means no opinionated ECS, no lighting, no rendering. We only want tools, not opinions in the framework.
  - Build the game as an engine on top of the framework.
