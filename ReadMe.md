# FlatEarth
FlatEarth aims to be a lightweight, but thorough framework that makes creating 2D games in Monogame fast and easy. It is loosely based off of the Monocle Engine.

## Features
FlatEarth's feature-set is slim but expanding. It currently provides a nice layer over Monogame to greatly ease development in key areas while maintaining a hands-off approach to how you structure your game. Use the entity component system or roll your own; FlatEarth doesn't dictate how you work.

### Complete

* Input Mapping
* Collision Detection
* Letterbox/Pillarbox
* Layered Rendering
* Entity Component System
  
### Todo / Incomplete

* Lighting
* Shadows
* Particle Engine
* Content Hot Reloading
* Better Actor System
* Better Tile Support
* Documentation

## Goals

1. Provide a framework that let's developers get up and running with 2D game development quickly.
2. Do not dictate how the game should be created; keep everything decoupled or loosely connected.
3. Stay lightweight and fast.
4. Provide thorough documentation and usage examples.
